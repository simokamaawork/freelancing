Dear freelancer.
In this assignment, students are tasked with designing a text-based adventure gameLinks to an external site.. This game should utilize the Python essentials covered thus far, including, but not limited to:
•	Strings and String Manipulation
•	User-Defined Functions and Objects (variables)
•	User Input and Input Handling
•	Conditional and Nested Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)
•	Loops (for/while)
•	Controlling for Errors (try/except)
The working version of the game should include:
An executable script (a script that runs from beginning to end upon execution) that includes:
•	a game that can be successfully completed within a maximum of 3 minutes (i.e., you can win the game in 3 minutes or less)
•	for a passing grade, your text adventure game must include a minimum of:
o	3 stages (maximum of 5 stages)
o	5 defined variables
o	1 list
o	1 for loop
o	1 while loop
o	3 nested conditional statements (all must include an else clause)
o	1 win() function (Executed whenever a user wins the game. There must be only one win function)
o	1 fail() function (Executed whenever a user loses the game. There must be only one fail function)
•	A description at the beginning of game that:
o	Is no more than 300 words
o	Introduces the story, game, and its objective
o	Identifies any bugs that are not yet worked out

## what am supposed to do 


1. **Executable Script:**
   - Start with a script that runs from beginning to end.
   - Utilize the necessary Python essentials mentioned (strings, functions, user input handling, conditional statements, loops, error handling).

2. **Game Structure:**
   - Design the game to be completed within a maximum of 3 minutes.
   - Divide the game into stages (between 3 to 5 stages).

3. **Variables:**
   - Define at least 5 variables to store information relevant to the game.
   - Ensure meaningful use of these variables within the game.

4. **List:**
   - Include at least one list in your game (perhaps to store items, choices, or game states).

5. **Loops:**
   - Use at least one `for` loop for iteration.
   - Use at least one `while` loop for dynamic or time-based elements.

6. **Conditional Statements:**
   - Implement at least 3 nested conditional statements, each with an `else` clause.
   - These can be used for decision-making, branching the story, or handling user choices.

7. **Functions:**
   - Create a `win()` function that executes when the user wins the game.
   - Create a `fail()` function that executes when the user loses.
   - Ensure there is only one function for each outcome.

8. **Game Introduction:**
   - Write a game introduction of no more than 300 words.
   - Introduce the story, game objective, and any relevant information for the player.

9. **Bug Identification:**
   - Clearly identify any known bugs or issues in the introduction.
   - Mention that these are aspects you are aware of and plan to work out.

10. **Testing:**
    - Test the game to ensure it can be completed within the specified time frame.
    - Test for any logical errors or unexpected behaviors.

11. **Documentation:**
    - Include comments and documentation within your code for clarity.
    - Mention any areas that could be improved or expanded upon in future versions.

Once you have these elements in place, you should have a solid foundation for your text-based adventure game. Good luck, and have fun with the development! If you need any assistance or guidance along the way, feel free to ask.
