It sounds like you've got quite the task ahead of you! First things first, make sure you download the datasets mentioned in the Moodle links provided. Take a good look at the detailed descriptionsâ€”they're like your roadmap for this project.

Start by understanding the problem at hand. The manufacturing company wants you to create a Machine Learning solution. For the first part, they need you to estimate the lifespan of a metal part based on certain parameters. The second part involves developing a solution to automatically classify whether a part is defective or not using provided scans.

Now, let's break it down:

1. **Estimating Lifespan:**
   - Open Dataset 1 and identify the processing parameters and measurements.
   - Consider what type of regression model would be suitable for estimating lifespan based on these parameters. Linear regression might be a good starting point.
   - Develop your code in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and ensure you export it as a PDF for submission.

2. **Defect Classification:**
   - Open Dataset 2 and check the images from scanning the parts' surfaces.
   - Think about which machine learning model would be appropriate for image classification. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image tasks.
   - Again, use a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and export it as a PDF.

Remember, documentation is key. Your final report (in PDF format) should include details on your approach, the models you chose, any preprocessing steps, and the results.
