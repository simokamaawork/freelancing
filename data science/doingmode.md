It sounds like you've got quite the task ahead of you! First things first, make sure you download the datasets mentioned in the Moodle links provided. Take a good look at the detailed descriptionsâ€”they're like your roadmap for this project.

Start by understanding the problem at hand. The manufacturing company wants you to create a Machine Learning solution. For the first part, they need you to estimate the lifespan of a metal part based on certain parameters. The second part involves developing a solution to automatically classify whether a part is defective or not using provided scans.

Now, let's break it down:

1. **Estimating Lifespan:**
   - Open Dataset 1 and identify the processing parameters and measurements.
   - Consider what type of regression model would be suitable for estimating lifespan based on these parameters. Linear regression might be a good starting point.
   - Develop your code in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and ensure you export it as a PDF for submission.

2. **Defect Classification:**
   - Open Dataset 2 and check the images from scanning the parts' surfaces.
   - Think about which machine learning model would be appropriate for image classification. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image tasks.
   - Again, use a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and export it as a PDF.

Remember, documentation is key. Your final report (in PDF format) should include details on your approach, the models you chose, any preprocessing steps, and the results.

Given the nature of your dataset, where you want to estimate the lifespan of metal parts based on various parameters, linear regression could be a good starting point. Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (lifespan).

Here's why linear regression might be a good fit:

1. **Interpretability:** Linear regression provides clear interpretations of the coefficients for each feature. You can easily understand how each parameter contributes to the predicted lifespan.

2. **Simplicity:** Linear regression is a simple and easy-to-understand model. It's a good choice when you're starting with a basic understanding of the relationship between the input features and the output.

3. **Assumption of Linearity:** Since you're assuming a linear relationship between the features and lifespan, linear regression aligns with this assumption.

However, it's always a good idea to experiment with different regression models to see which one performs best for your specific dataset. You might also want to explore more complex models like decision trees, random forests, or even polynomial regression to capture potential non-linear relationships.

Here's a basic outline of what you can do:

1. **Split your data:** Divide your dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

2. **Train the model:** Use the training set to train your linear regression model.

3. **Evaluate the model:** Use the testing set to evaluate how well your model generalizes to new data.

4. **Adjust and iterate:** If the performance is not satisfactory, consider trying other regression models or tweaking parameters.

Remember, the best model depends on the characteristics of your data, so it's a good idea to experiment and see what works best in your specific case. Good luck!
